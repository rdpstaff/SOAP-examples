Sample code for accessing RDP's soap services

Currently samples exist for ruby and perl.  As far as I'm aware JAX-WS does not play well with python 
wsdl generation implementations.

Java clients can be easily created by binding the WSDL of the service you wish to use to java objects
using the wsimport tool.

A detailed description of the services can be found at http://rdp.cme.msu.edu/help/webServices.jsp
